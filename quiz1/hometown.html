            <p>My hometown, Karawang, is a city just east of Bekasi and Jakarta. It used to be renowned as one of the largest wheat production sites in Indonesia. 
                But nowadays, it's more commonly known for its Industrial Area. It is home to 2.5 million lives, making it a considerably populated city. </p>
            <p>While it is one of the larger city in Java, and directly reachable to the Capital of Jakarta, it is rather unknown at large. 
                This is partly due to Karawang's development spread that is one sided to the main city 
                itself which contributed to the large portion of the city being a rural area with subpar accessibility.</p>
            <p>The name "Karawang" itself might be foreign to most people, but it is arguably one of the most industrially 
                impactful place in Indonesia, as a large portion of the city is dubbed "Industrial Area". This also contributed to 
                Karawang having the highest minimum-wage in Indonesia, alongside its neighbor Cikarang. Another "hidden" fact of Karawang 
                is that it's home to Rengasdengklok, the place that Soekarno is kidnapped into during the moments leading to the independence 
                declaration. Nowadays, the house that Soekarno got kidnapped into is made into a museum.</p>
