                Sorabi Hejo (English: Green Serabi) is the signature dish of Karawang. It is registered as one of Karawang's non-object 
                cultural heritage (WBTB). Its appearance is similiar to that of a pancake, made made of a rice flour-based batter with 
                coconut milk or coconut cream and shredded coconut as an emulsifier. Sorabi Hejo is unique in that it is green in color, 
                rather than white or cream like other Serabis. This color is achieved through the use of Suji leaves. It is very dominantly sweet in taste,
                rather than savoury like the other Serabi.

                While there is a lot of variation in the topping or the taste of Sorabi Hejo, the most popular one uses Durian Syrup as the topping and flavour.
                It has an incredibly unique taste, as it is sweet but not overwhelming in any sense. For those looking to taste one for themselves,
                I would recommend the "original" Sorabi Hejo, located in Rengasdengklok. It is said that this particular one is the pioneer of Sorabi Hejo 
                and is immensely popular with the locals.
